\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Project Idea}

 We are proposing a platform for vending machine functionalities and management to be  handled by cloud using Internet of things.Online payment for vending machines made possible and stock record maintained on the cloud for dynamically updating the vendor .


\section{Motivation of the Project}  

 Presently the people use coins or paper money while operating the vending machines due to this there arises a problem when the user does not seem to have exact change with him and the vendors dont come to know about the stock required in the vending machines when excess usage is done.Hence to minimize these problems we provide an efficient solution.

\section{Literature Survey}
 Physical Web with Vending machine.

Abstract:
A vending machine is a machine that dispenses items such  as snacks, beverages to customers automatically, after the customer inserts currency or credit into the machine. We are proposing a Platform for vending machine functionalities and management to be  handled by cloud using Internet of things.But nowadays paying in cash has become a difficulty and cannot be fulfilled every time.Therefore we suggest a platform for the vending machine functionalities and management to be  handled by cloud using Internet of things.With this approach Online payment for vending machines can be made possible and the stock record is maintained on the cloud for dynamically updating the vendor. In addition to which the users are notified about the presence of the vending machine using Web Bluetooth API.

Introduction:

 The Physical Web is a generic term which describes interconnection of physical objects and web. The Physical Web lets to present physical objects in a web. There are different ways to do that.Usually, the web presentation for a physical object could implement with the help
of mobile devices. The basic idea behind the Physical Web is to navigate and control physical objects in the world surrounding
mobile devices with the help of web technologies. Of course, there are different ways to identify and enumerate physical objects.
Nowadays operating the vending machines has been difficult due to cash payments and location issues.

How to overcome this issue?
 We hereby suggest such types of vending machines which offer Online (cashless) payments for the users for easy purchase of items and the Vendors are well informed about the stock management of the machine and they are also aware of the customers past transactions.To begin with we will have a Wi-Fi enabled board on the vending machines which will send beacons to the mobile phones having Bluetooth in their vicinity.
Nowadays bluetooth is an open specification for short-range wireless communication and networking, mainly intended to be a cable replacement between portable and/or fixed electronic devices. The specification also defines techniques for interconnecting large number of nodes in scatternets,thus enabling the establishment of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET).
The user will receive a notification which will contain a URL flashed by the beacon on his cellphone along with suggestions for other products.
and will hence find and approach the vending machine and click on the desired product on his cellphone.The transaction is carried out using the online payment gateways or mobile wallet and is recorded and stored in the cloud which is used for future transactions.
In this project we are using Cloud computing in the functioning of the data,cloud computing has recently emerged as a new
paradigm for hosting and delivering services over the Internet. It is attractive to business owners as it eliminates the requirement for users to plan ahead for provisioning, and allows enterprises to start from the small and increase resources only when there is a rise in service demand.
Many different algorithms are going to be used in this project namely - The travelling salesperson algorithm,Depth first search.Using such algorithms we will provide a platform which will help the vendors manage the functioning of the vending machines in near future.


\chapter{Problem Definition and scope}
\section{Problem Statement}
 To Automate vending machine functionalities for vendors and enabling easy accessibility for users through online payment and establishing a physical interface with the help of beacons. 


\subsection{Goals and objectives}  
Project Goal :Presently operating the vending machines is not user-friendly and it is observed to be time consuming as well.Our project goal is to increase the scope and quality of the vending machine services provided to the people. 

Project Objective 1:
People use coins or paper money while operating the vending machines due to which there arises a problem when the user does not seem to have exact change with him.
Performance Measure :
Online (cashless) payments are made available for the users for easy purchase of items.

Project Objective 2:
The vendors are not aware about the stock required in the vending machines when excess usage of the products occur.
Performance Measure :
Vendors are well informed about the stock management of the machine and are also aware of the customers past transactions.

Project Objective 3 :
Finding a vending machine in new locations everytime becomes difficult for people.
Performance Measure :
The users are notified about the presence of the vending machine available in their current location using the Web Bluetooth API.
	
 \subsection{Statement of scope} 
This project will consist of creating a platform for vending machine functionalities and management to be  handled by cloud using Internet of things.Online payment for vending machines made possible and stock record maintained on the cloud for dynamically updating the vendor. Modules of the platform will include a firmware where hardware is used,cloud communication and a frontend available for users as well as for vendors respectively.

Limit of the project will be internet dependency ,so better connection is required otherwise the entire system flops .


Functionality mechanism is concentrated on removing the cash payment barrier on the vending machine .

Final product will be used at public places like railway stations,airports,bus stands and can be used by private vendors.
\section{Software context} 
Online payment for vending machines made possible and stock record maintained on the cloud for dynamically updating the vendor. Modules of the platform will include a firmware where hardware is used,cloud communication and a frontend available for users as well as for vendors respectively.
The software entities used are Web Bluetooth API,Linux,Eclipse(mars).
Web bluetooth is the technology in which a bluetooth enabled device is used to flash url which can notify people about a thing in the area ,This is a way towards making things speak .
This device is placed at the vending machine and configured to flash a particular url using Seripheral Interface from the controller .
The controller is wifi enabled ,so cloud communication is done using awsiot js sdk on the device .
The cloud communication also happens at the user side for  payment and then the cloud notifies the vending machine that payment is done and vending machine disposes the product.
\section{Major Constraints}
Need of google chrome browser
The user should have google chrome browser to take advantage of this service as currently the web bluetooth technology is supported by only google chrome.

Availability of Wi-Fi connections.
The vending machine should be placed in the place where wifi availability is there ,for smoother connection and faster product delivery.If the internet fluctuates then user will have to wait for product and this in turn lead to decrease in product sale.
 
Location of the vending machines.
Vending machine should be placed where it can be accesible to the people i.e the bluetooth range .


\section{Methodologies of Problem solving and efficiency issues}
The single problem can be solved by different solutions.  This considers the performance parameters for each approach. Thus considers the efficiency issues.

\section{Scenario in which multi-core, Embedded and Distributed Computing used}

 We will have a Wi-Fi enabled board on the vending machines which will send beacons to the mobile phones having Bluetooth in their vicinity.
 
 The user will receive a notification which will contain a URL flashed by the beacon on his cellphone along with suggestions for other products.

The user will hence find and approach the vending machine and click on the desired product on his cellphone.

 The transaction is carried out using the online payment gateways or mobile wallet and is recorded and stored in the cloud which is used for future transactions.

 The vending machine then dispenses the product ordered by the user.

The vendor will have an updated list of the stock remaining in the cloud.

\section{Outcome}

 Online (cashless) payments are available for the users for easy purchase of items.
Vendors are well informed about the stock management of the machine and they are also aware of the customers past transactions.

\chapter{Laboratory assignments on Project Quality and Reliability Testing of Project Design}

It should include assignments such as\\
 Use of divide and conquer strategies to exploit distributed/parallel/concurrent processing of the above to identify object, morphisms, overloading in functions (if any), and functional relations and any other dependencies (as per requirements).\\
             It can include Venn diagram, state diagram, function relations, i/o relations; use this to derive objects, morphism, overloading\\

 Use of above to draw functional dependency graphs and relevant Software modeling methods, techniques including UML diagrams or other necessities using appropriate tools.
 \\
Testing of project problem statement using generated test data (using mathematical models, GUI, Function testing principles, if any) selection and appropriate use of testing tools, testing of UML diagram's reliability. Write also test cases [Black box testing] for each identified functions. \\
 Additional assignments by the guide. If project type as Entreprenaur, Refer \cite{ehr},\cite{mckinsey},\cite{mckinseyweb}, \cite{govwebsite}
